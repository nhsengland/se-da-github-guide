    "text": "Setting up Git in VSCode\nBefore we get started using Git in VSCode, for the first time only, it needs to be configured. Yes, it uses the Terminal window, but it’s not scary!\nThis can be done either by: - Open ‘Terminal’ from the search on your desktop taskbar - Open ‘Terminal’ in VSCode (‘View’ -&gt; ‘Terminal’)\nIn either one, type in the following: git config –global user.name “githubusername” &lt;- Enter your own GitHub username in the quotations, then hit enter git config –global user.email “email@nhs.net” &lt;- Enter your own email address associated with your GitHub account in the quotations, then hit enter\nThat’s it :star:\n\n\nInitialising a repository\nCreate the repo before you start coding Create the repo before you start coding Create the repo before you start coding\nThe best thing to do is to create the repo before (or as soon to the beginning as possible) starting writing your actual code. Think of it as this: you wouldn’t work on a big excel file without saving first, in case you lost it. The same applies here.\nThe way that Git works, you work on files saved in a local folder, then push to GitHub when you’re done (so you’re never working directly in GitHub). So, to start, you need to create a local blank folder for you to start with (or where you existing folder is). Recommendation is to create a ‘GitHub’ folder in your OneDrive, where the repo folders can sit.\nTo intisialise a repo, click the Source Control button on the left panel:\n\nClick ‘Open Folder’ and navigate to the repo folder (in your ‘OneDrive’ folder). Note: you may be asked whether you trust the authors of the files in the folder. Usually this is yes, as it’s from your own OneDrive.\nNow we’ve selected the folder, we can now initialise the repository:\n\nThis won’t yet appear on the GitHub web browser (as we haven’t published yet) - we will get to that.\n\n\nCloning a repository\nIf, instead of creating your own repo from scratch, you want to take something someone else has done for yourself, you can clone the repo. To do this, click ‘Clone Repository’ instead:\n\n(Note: if you’re already working on a repo, you can clear what you’re working on by opening a new window (File -&gt; New window) or by closing the current folder (File -&gt; Close folder)).\nIn the top bar, click ‘Clone from GitHub’ and start typing for the repo you want.\n\nSave to your ‘OneDrive’ folder. You can now work on the files.\n\n\nBranching\nNow, the whole point of GitHub is to work collaboratively, so there will be times where you want to clone someone’s repo and make your own additions. This is also best practice for your own repos: when adding a new development, create a new branch. Never work in ‘main’.\nThis is where branches come in.\nOnce you’ve cloned a repo, ensure you are in your Source Control view and click the ‘…’ as shown below.\n\nAnd enter the desired branch name (e.g. ‘dev’)\n\nSwitching branches: you can switch branches within VSCode in the bottom left of the screen:\n\nIn your branch, you can work on you script, add and delete files etc. If you want, it can be merged to the ‘main’ branch, which we will again get to…\n\n\nTracking and staging\nOnce you’ve done the above, you can now make changes to the repository. This could be: - Changing an existing file (e.g. adding new lines of code) - Adding new files (including codefiles) into the repo - Removing files from the repo (be careful of dependencies!)\nThis is where the real power of GitHub comes in - tracking changes without losing what you’ve already done.\nFirst, another best practice to remember: COMMIT OFTEN, PERFECT LATER, PUBLISH ONCE\nIf you commit smaller changes it’s far easier to go back if you’ve made a mistake and saves more work down the line. Again, think of it as saving an excel workbook.\nThe how to bit: Once you’ve changed something, navigate to the Source Control tab again. You’ll see a ‘changes’ section in the source control, as below.\n\n\nCommit\nIncluding a bit on the Git Log\n\n\nGit restore\n\n\nMerge\n\n\nMerge conflicts\n\n\nGit Log\n\n\ndiff\n\n\nRoll back\n\n\nGit revert\n\n\nPublishing an existing repo\n\n\nPush and pull\n\n\nForking and cloning\n\n\nPull requests\n\n\nIssues",

Give the branch a name that helps you identify what a change relates to.\nIf working on larger changes, it may be best to break it down into smaller steps and develop and QA iteratively - you can branch off your branch to help with this.\nGitHub will provide an audit trail of changes made, when they were made, and who made them. This aligns nicely with the team’s QASAR process. It is also easy to roll back to an earlier version if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRemember that we don’t have enterprise licences so we can’t protect our main branches.

To create a repo, click the green New button in the left hand Top Repositories section.\n\nWe will also find this button in the Repositories sections on our profile and within any organisations that we are part of. They all lead to the same place. Which is here:\n\nUnpopulatedPopulated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, there are several things that need filling, and some that don’t. We take them from the top:\n\nRepository template- There is a se-template team template you can choose to use. It will initialise a repo with a gitignore, SOP folder and template, and README template with some key reporting info for you to easily edit. If you don’t want to use this template, feel free to leave this as No template.\nOwner- Depending on where you were when you clicked the New Repository button, this will default to either your own account or one of your organisations. It’s up to you where you store your repos but, generally, you would want to put work that you intend to share with colleagues within the organisation and keep only personal things in your own area.\nRepository name- This should be a unique name that is short but reasonably descriptive. GitHub will handily tell you if the name is already in use somewhere else. Repo names shouldn’t include spaces but don’t worry if you forget, GitHub will replace spaces with hyphens.\nDescription- Although this field is optional, it’s a good idea to put something in here to help you (and others) quickly identify what the code is.\nPublic / Private- If you select Public then anyone anywhere can see your repo and the code within it. Selecting Private means that only those within the organisation (if the owner is an organisation) can see the code. Generally, this should be the default option- you can always change the privacy later.\nAdd a README file- Again, this is optional but generally a good idea. It will automatically create a markdown file with the repo name as the title and the description as the contents. You can then add details about the project including inputs, outputs, purpose, methodology etc. which will help you and others trying to use your code later.\nAdd .gitignore- A gitignore file tells GitHub which files to not look at and not publish. This could be things like data or personal user keys that you don’t want to share. We will use these more when we look at using GitHub Desktop but it is less important if you just plan to upload files manually.\nChoose a license- This just tells people what they can do with their code. You can leave this as None if you want or, if you’re happy for people to use and replicate your code as they please, you might choose the MIT License.\n\nNow you can click Create repository.",

    "text": "Key Concepts\n\nWhat is a repository?\n\nA repository is a place that contains all your code and files associated with a piece of work.\nGenerally, you would have a separate repository for each of your projects.\nSee here for a guide on how to create a repository in the SE D&A area.\n\n\n\nCloning\n\nWhat is cloning?\n\nCloning a Git repository means creating a local copy of a remote repository on your computer.\nOnce you have cloned a repository, you can start working on the project, making and saving changes, and committing them to your local repository, without changing the remote version.\n\n\n\nWhy clone?\n\nContribute to group projects - where multiple people work on the same code base, cloning enables individuals to edit and save the code without impacting on other users.\nMake use of other open source repositories - you can use and edit code from other people’s code, even if you don’t know them.\n\n\n\n\nBranching\n\nWhat is branching and why do we use it?\nA branch is a separate version of the main repository. Branching allows you to work on a different part of a project without impacting the main repository. When any development or work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can read more about the lego analogy here (https://opensource.com/article/22/4/git-branches/).\n\n\n\n\n\nFetching\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that one of the strengths of using Git and GitHub is that we can all work collaboratively, it is important to make sure that the version we are using is up to date with any changes that have been made to the repository. This is what fetching does.\n\nFetch lets us review what changes have been made in the remote repository before we add them to our local version.\nThe alternative option is called pulling. The difference here is that this automatically makes changes from the remote repository to the local version.\nFetch is the safer option as it lets us see what any changes are before we adopt them.\n\n\n\n\nStaging, Committing, and Pushing\nOnce you have made a change to a script you can stage it, the next step is to commit it, and finally you can push it to the remote repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBefore any of these steps, you should check that you haven’t included anything sensitive that shouldn’t be shared e.g. data.\n\n\nStaging allows you to group any changes to different, but related, files so that they are in the same commit.\nYou may choose not to push your committed changes immediately e.g. if you are still in the process of making changes, but it allows you to separate your changes into stages and keep a record of those. Commits are the units of undo i.e. you can roll back the changes by commit, so it’s worth thinking about what you include in each commit (and don’t make them too large).\n\n\nPull requests\nA pull request is how you make a request to merge your branch to another branch e.g. move your changes to the main branch. If there are things that disagree between the branches that you are trying to merge, this is called a conflict. You have to resolve these before you can merge. If there are no conflicts, your pull request can be actioned immediately and the branches will be merged.",

A .gitignore is a file that contains all of the files and folders from the project that you do not want Git to log and track.\nYou have some options for specifying files in the gitignore. Common ones are below:\n\nYou can explicitly reference a file path within the project structure e.g.to ignore a file called data_load in a folder called helper:\n\n\nhelper/data_load.R\n\n\nYou can ignore all files of a certain extension e.g. to ignore all .xlsx files:\n\n\n*.xlsx\n\n\nYou can add whole folders to the gitignore e.g. to ignore the folder called output:\n\n\noutput/\n\n\nYou can exclude files from the gitignore e.g. you want to ignore all .pptx files except the one called final.pptx:\n\n\n*.pptx !final.pptx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn GitHub desktop you can add files to the gitignore by right clicking on the file and clicking Ignore file. Or add all files of that type by right clicking and choosing e.g. Ignore all .xlsx files. In VSCode, ignored files are greyed out in the file explorer.\n\n\nYour repository should always have a gitignore file in the root folder. When you initialise a repo you can choose to use a gitignore tailored to particular programming languages but the South East template repo has a gitignore that should be a good place to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are looking to create a .gitignore that covers a wide range of software, websites such as (https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore?) can be worth playing with",

In order to push to a remote repository later on you add that remote repository by using the Git shell. If you already know which online repository you want to use for your projects, option c) is more convenient.\nb) Create a new project from a folder under version control: In this case you only need to create a new RStudio project for that directory and version control is automatically enabled. Go to File &gt; New Project, select create a new project from an Existing Directory and create the project.\nc) Create a new project based on a remote Git repository: Select File &gt; New Project.. and from the opening menu select to create a new project from Version Control, Choose Git, then provide the repository url (use the https link of the url if you want to avoid all the ssh trouble) from the the repository you want to clone and create the project.\nIn this tutorial we **create a project by cloning a remote GitHub repository (option c). Hence we first create a new repository on GitHub and then use RStudio to clone that repository and set up our GitHub project.\n1. Create a new GitHub repository: Login to your GitHub account and create a new GitHub repository. Give your new repository a short and memorable name e.g. rstudio-git-test, check the option to initialize this repository with a README and create the repository.\n2. Copy the repository HTTPS url: To create a new Git based project in RStudio, we need the repository url. You find the repository HTTPS url on the just created GitHub project page. There press the button &lt;&gt; Code (green button) and copy the HTTPS link of the project by clicking the little icon to the right of the URL. The link will be something like https://github.com/yourusername/rstudio-git-test.git.\n3. Create a new RStudio project with Git version control: Now everything is ready to create a new project with Git version control in RStudio.
